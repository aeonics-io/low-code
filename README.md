# low-code
This repository exposes the low-code templates available from the Aeonics web interface.

The low-code elements can be published directly on the Aeonics system as-is without compilation,
the system will deploy and run it automatically in a serverless fashion.

Please refer to the Aeonics SDK documentation for detailed javadoc and other content.
